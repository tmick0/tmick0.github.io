Travis Mick is a software engineer at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, NM. He is also the CTO and cofounder of [Zeall.us](http://zeall.us/), where he leads backend development efforts. He attended New Mexico State University for Computer Science, where he received his B.S. in December 2014 and M.S. in May 2017.

A background in network security research has fostered in him a passion for values such as digital privacy, net neutrality, and intellectual freedom. In a world where these causes are increasingly important, he aims to both raise awareness of them and further their goals through technology.
